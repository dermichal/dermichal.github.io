Breath, meditate, get into base line mood.
From this objective position journal to get shit out of monkeymind.
Plan the day accordingly so you can run the day,
instead of the day running you.
Stay on top of things, move them forward bird by bird.
Avoid stupid distractions.
Smile and find joy in every little moment, it is all there will ever be.
