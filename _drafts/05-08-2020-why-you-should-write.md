# Create ideas
Writing my be far more important than it may appear at first glance. It doesn't only communicate ideas, the process of writing generates them. Skipping a regular writing routing also means missing out on all the ideas it generates.

# Boost learning
Writing is useful as it catalyses learning through the unveiling of the illusions of knowledge your brain was making up. Trying to explain something in written form imminently discovers gaps in your logic that otherwise will be hidden from you as your simulator, the prefrontal cortex, fills the gaps to create coherent stories. Writing unveils the illusions of knowledge.

# Be useful
Writing about something you have just learned is also useful to people one step behind you in the learning process. The material is still present in your working memory. It provides an advantage over experts as the reasons for why a topic may be hard to understand for the beginner get lost over time.
Your background, domain knowledge and your style will give a different flavour to whatever you're writing about.

# Blog
Blogging elevates the advantages of writing by providing slight pressure and accountability. It helps you finish and close a piece as well as makes it worldwide available to others that may find it useful. This way blogging may help you to connect with likeminded people. Remember talent/characters are global, opportunities and mindset are not.
