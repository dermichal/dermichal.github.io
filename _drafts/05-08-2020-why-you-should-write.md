# Create ideas
As [Paul Graham][pg_writing_briefly] puts it writing my be far more important than it may appear at first glance. It doesn't only communicate ideas, the process of writing generates them. Skipping a regular writing routine also means missing out on all the ideas it generates.

# Boost learning
Writing is useful as it catalyses learning through the unveiling of the illusions of knowledge your brain was making up. When thinking about a topic you just read about you may have the impression to have fully understood and incorporated it. But trying to explain it to somebody may reveal a different truth as you then realize the gaps you had in your understanding.
Explaining something in written form imminently discovers gaps in your logic that otherwise will be hidden from you as your simulator, the prefrontal cortex, fills the gaps to create coherent stories. Over time the unstoppable decay of your knowledge is responsible for the limited information you keep on a certain topic. Our brains suffer under confirmation bias, one of the cognitive biases described by Daniel Kahnemann in _Thinking Fast and Slow_. They try to fill in the gaps and jump to conclusions to create a perfect story, often disregarding the lack of evidence to support our story. Staying humble and keeping a daily writing routine unveils your illusions of knowledge.

# Be useful
While diving into [fast.ai] in the recent CAS at Sitem I stumbled upon an interesting Blog by [Rachel Thomas]. Writing about something you have just learned is also useful to people one step behind you in the learning process [^1]. The material is still present in your working memory. It provides an advantage over experts as the reasons for why a topic may be hard to understand for the beginner get lost over time.
Your background, domain knowledge and your style will give a different flavour to whatever you're writing about.

# Blog
Blogging elevates the advantages of writing by providing slight pressure and accountability. It helps you finish and close a piece as well as makes it worldwide available to others that may find it useful. This way blogging may help you to connect with likeminded people. Remember talent/characters are global, opportunities and mindset are not.

[^1]: Referring to the learning process in the Artificial Intelligence course I was taking at Sitem. A tutoring system is on its way as of the time of writing. It motivates me to write and share my experiences with the next generation of domain experts.
