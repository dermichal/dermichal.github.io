Welcome to the inner searchings of my sould. Here I try to capture and redefine myself over and over again. The following is some content on updating my identity...

Posts may include quotes from authors that influenced my thinking or stories from people that served me as rolemodels.

I hope some of the questions and ideas mentioned can be of use to you.

Enjoy!

# Why are you doing?

Focus on what you really want. Stop telling yourself stories and look at your actions. They reveal what you really like/hate doing.

What do you do for money/attention? What if you were fully fed up with both? What would be left?

Time is precious and scarce. Use it wisely. Live in the moment. Be free from mind. `@naval`
